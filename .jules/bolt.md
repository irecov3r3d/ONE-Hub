## 2024-05-20 - Consolidated Audio Analysis Pipeline
**Learning:** The previous audio analysis pipeline performed multiple O(N) traversals for mono conversion, peak detection, DC offset, and RMS calculation. By consolidating these into a single-pass loop in `analyzeBasicStats`, we reduce CPU overhead and cache misses significantly.
**Action:** Always look for opportunities to merge buffer traversals in audio processing services.

## 2024-05-20 - Memory Efficiency in FFT Windowing
**Learning:** Using `.slice()` on large typed arrays like `Float32Array` during windowing (e.g., for FFTs or spectrograms) creates expensive copies. Switching to `.subarray()` provides a view of the existing memory, which is much faster and reduces GC pressure, provided the receiving function is non-mutating.
**Action:** Prefer `.subarray()` over `.slice()` for read-only windowing operations on TypedArrays.

## 2026-03-25 - In-Place Mastering Chain Performance
**Learning:** The previous `AudioMasteringService` processing chain created new `Float32Array` buffers for every effect stage (Compression, Saturation, Exciter, Limiting, Dithering). For a 4-minute stereo track at 44.1kHz, each allocation is ~42MB. 8+ such allocations per mastering pass caused significant GC pressure and potentially hundreds of megabytes of overhead. Refactoring these to be in-place eliminates this overhead entirely.
**Action:** In high-throughput audio pipelines, prioritize in-place buffer mutation over functional-style immutability to minimize memory churn.

## 2026-03-25 - Iterative In-Place FFT for Memory Efficiency
**Learning:** Recursive FFT implementations like the previous `cooleyTukeyFFT` create $O(N \log N)$ small temporary buffers during the divide-and-conquer steps. For large FFT sizes (e.g., 32768) or high-frequency operations like spectrogram generation, this results in thousands of allocations and intense GC pressure. Switching to an iterative in-place algorithm with bit-reversal permutation reduces this to exactly ONE allocation per FFT pass.
**Action:** Replace recursive signal processing algorithms with iterative in-place versions to stabilize memory usage and improve performance on low-memory devices.
