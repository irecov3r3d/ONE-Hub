## 2024-05-20 - Consolidated Audio Analysis Pipeline
**Learning:** The previous audio analysis pipeline performed multiple O(N) traversals for mono conversion, peak detection, DC offset, and RMS calculation. By consolidating these into a single-pass loop in `analyzeBasicStats`, we reduce CPU overhead and cache misses significantly.
**Action:** Always look for opportunities to merge buffer traversals in audio processing services.

## 2024-05-20 - Memory Efficiency in FFT Windowing
**Learning:** Using `.slice()` on large typed arrays like `Float32Array` during windowing (e.g., for FFTs or spectrograms) creates expensive copies. Switching to `.subarray()` provides a view of the existing memory, which is much faster and reduces GC pressure, provided the receiving function is non-mutating.
**Action:** Prefer `.subarray()` over `.slice()` for read-only windowing operations on TypedArrays.

## 2026-03-25 - In-Place Mastering Chain Performance
**Learning:** The previous `AudioMasteringService` processing chain created new `Float32Array` buffers for every effect stage (Compression, Saturation, Exciter, Limiting, Dithering). For a 4-minute stereo track at 44.1kHz, each allocation is ~42MB. 8+ such allocations per mastering pass caused significant GC pressure and potentially hundreds of megabytes of overhead. Refactoring these to be in-place eliminates this overhead entirely.
**Action:** In high-throughput audio pipelines, prioritize in-place buffer mutation over functional-style immutability to minimize memory churn.

## 2026-03-25 - Iterative In-Place FFT Performance
**Learning:** Recursive FFT implementations in JavaScript/TypeScript suffer from $O(N \log N)$ small buffer allocations (one per recursive call), leading to extreme GC pressure for large audio buffers (e.g., 8192 or 16384 points). Implementing a non-recursive Cooley-Tukey FFT with bit-reversal reordering and in-place butterfly computation reduces allocations to $O(1)$ while maintaining algorithmic complexity.
**Action:** Prefer iterative in-place implementations for core signal processing algorithms to minimize memory churn.
